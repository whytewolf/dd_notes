basic RP.
met to children after a strange mysts took us to somewhere new.
stopped just shy of entering a dreaded house

## Sat Dec 21st

the house seems calm so far. almost peacful.
on the second floor found a note that said they worship strahd.
and 3 scrolls.

on the third floor, fought a suit of armor which we killed right quick.
and then a spector. the palidin almost died. but the druid use silvery barb
and undid all that. and the awesome rogue undid the undead.

_David is morning the undead._
