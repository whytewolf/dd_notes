## Sun Dec 15th

Found a bunch of drow that wanted avandar dead as much as us.
talked them into attacking with us. but they wanted us to take care of a
"problem" first. killed an invisable troll and they started respecting us.

setup a pincer attack pattern between them and the trogladytes.
the drow want all the glory of the kill and the upper level in exchange we get free passage.
the drow also promissed not to kill the troglodytes.

we slept for the night then went on the offensive.
